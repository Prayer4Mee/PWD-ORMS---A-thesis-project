# PWD-ORMS---A-thesis-project
PWD ORMS stands for Persons with Disabilities Online Registration and Management System.

What I contribute to this project is more on the front end namely the landing page and the login page. I tried to be meticulous as much as possible in designing
It's more on HTML, CSS, JS, PHP
With the Framework and library: Bootstrap and CodeIgniter

There is a lot we want to add but failed to do, but this is a fully functional project.
We wanted to add some functions like where clients user page can be edited inside the server admin page, but it wasn't easy.

There are only a few professors that properly teach programming so I apologize for bad coding practices
I hope that 5 years from now and when I'm more experienced, I will create this project again with my team to contribute to the PDAO Department at Caloocan!

If you're wondering if you can use this, Yes if you're going to present it to PDAO or a city hall near you, doesn't matter if they like it or not, accepted it or not.
As long as you accept it with good hope, that's all that matters.
